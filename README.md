# Frontend Mentor - Kanban task management web app solution

This is a solution to the [Kanban task management web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar

Expected Behaviour:

- Boards
  - Clicking different boards in the sidebar will change to the selected board.
  - Clicking "Create New Board" in the sidebar opens the "Add New Board" modal.
  - Clicking in the dropdown menu "Edit Board" opens up the "Edit Board" modal where details can be changed.
  - Columns are added and removed for the Add/Edit Board modals.
  - Deleting a board deletes all columns and tasks and requires confirmation.
- Columns
  - A board needs at least one column before tasks can be added. If no columns exist, the "Add New Task" button in the header is disabled.
  - Clicking "Add New Column" opens the "Edit Board" modal where columns are added.
- Tasks
  - Adding a new task adds it to the bottom of the relevant column.
  - Updating a task's status will move the task to the relevant column.

Bonus:

- The tasks can be dragged and dropped to a new column.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
